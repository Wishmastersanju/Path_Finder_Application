# Path_Finder_Application

**Path_Finder_Application** is an Android app built using **Android Studio (Java)** that helps users find the **shortest path between a source and destination** instantly. The shortest path calculation is powered by **Prim's Algorithm**, making the app both fast and efficient for basic route discovery.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Shortest Path Finder**: Calculates the shortest path between two points using Prim’s Algorithm.
- 🗺️ **Map Integration**: Uses **OpenStreetMap (OSMDroid)** for map rendering (no Google Cloud Console needed).
- 📱 **Two Layouts**:
  1. **Home Page**:
     - Simple interface with a login option and free user access.

## 🔒 Login System (Work in Progress)

The app includes a login interface for future premium or advanced functionality. However, all users currently have access to core features (login is optional and non-functional at this stage).

## 📌 Limitations

- ❌ Google Maps is not used (due to unavailable access to Google Cloud Console).
- 🚧 Login-based feature expansion is still under development.![path_finder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b98664-c754-4b5f-ac21-830a0b4ad652)
